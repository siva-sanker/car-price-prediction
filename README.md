# Used Car Price Prediction 🚗💸

A machine learning project to predict the **selling price of used cars** based on various car attributes. This helps buyers and sellers estimate a fair price for a used vehicle.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project builds a regression model that predicts the resale price of a used car using features such as car age, mileage, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and previous owners.

## 🛠️ Features Used

- **Year** (Year of manufacturing)
- **Kms Driven** (Distance driven by the car)
- **Fuel Type** (Petrol, Diesel, or CNG)
- **Transmission** (Manual or Automatic)


## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize relationships and distributions.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create useful features such as car age from the year.
4. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models like Random Forest Regressor.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate performance using metrics such as R² and RMSE.
6. **Model Saving**: Save the trained model for future prediction use.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Model

- **Linear Regression** — a simple and interpretable model for regression tasks.
